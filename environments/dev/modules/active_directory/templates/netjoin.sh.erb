# Not entirely secure script to handle automatic joining of a
# Linux/Solaris system onto an AD domain. Should be good enough since
# the only time we'll be running this is right after a reinstall, and
# nobody could log into the system anyway.

# Usage: netjoin.sh /path/to/samba/binary/net ad-hostname pdc-hostname
#
# Where: /path/to/samba/binary/net -- path to the Samba "net" binary
#        ad-hostname -- name for Machine account (normally
#                       `hostname`-linux or `hostname`-solaris)
#        pdc-hostname -- FQDN for primary domain controller
